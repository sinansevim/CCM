     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     Fft bands division:     nmany     =       1

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./outdir/nbse2.save/
     file Se.rel-pbe-n-kjpaw_psl.0.2.UPF: wavefunction(s)  4S 4P renormalized
     file Nb.rel-pbe-spn-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF: wavefunction(s)  4S 4P 4P 4D renormalized

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
